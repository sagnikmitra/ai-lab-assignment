## AI Lab Assignment

1. Design Tic-tac-toe game in artificial intelligence.
2. Implement BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search) algorithms with several graphs.
3. Implement uniform cost search algorithm (Dijkstra algorithm).
4. Implement the A* algorithm in of a graph with given heuristic.
5. Implement a search algorithm for solving the 8-puzzle problem with following assumptions:
          I. g(n) = least cost from source state to current state so far.
          II. Heuristics
              a. h1(n) = 0.
              b. h2(n) = number of tiles displaced from their destined position.
              c. h3(n) = sum of Manhattan distance of each tiles from the goal position.
              d. h4(n) = Devise a heuristics such that h(n) > h*(n).
6. Implement AO* algorithm to solve a game tree.
